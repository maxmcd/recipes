# AIP Baked Ribs

## Ingredients

 - 2 tbsp smoked sea salt
 - ¼ tsp. ground cloves
 - oregano
 - green onions

 - 1 rack pork ribs (15.5 oz / 440 g)
 - 2 Tablespoons of honey (30 ml)
 - 2 Tablespoons of applesauce (30 ml)
 - 2 Tablespoons of coconut aminos (30 ml)
 - 1 Tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil
 - 1 Tablespoon (5 g) fresh ginger, minced
 - 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
 - Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 275°F / 135°C.
1. Rub salt over the ribs.
1. Roll out a long piece of aluminium foil. Grease it and place the ribs onto it. Wrap the foil tightly around the rack of ribs to ensure that no air can escape at all. Place onto a tray and cook in the oven for 3 hours.
1. Whisk the honey, applesauce, coconut aminos, olive oil, garlic and ginger together in a bowl. After 3 hours, remove the ribs from the oven and increase the heat of the oven to max.
1. Allow the foil parcel to cool slightly before opening it up completely to expose the ribs. Use a pastry brush to brush the marinade on the rack of ribs and place back into the oven for 3-5 minutes until the glaze has become sticky.
